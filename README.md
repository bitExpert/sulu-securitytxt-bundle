This is a Sulu Bundle to manage security.txt files for your Sulu webspaces.

According to [securitytxt.org](https://securitytxt.org) the main purpose of security.txt is to help make things easier for companies and security researchers when trying to secure platforms. Thanks to security.txt, security researchers can easily get in touch with companies about security issues.

## Installation

```bash
composer require bitexpert/sulu-securitytxt-bundle
```

1. Register the bundle in the file `config/bundles.php`
```php
BitExpert\Sulu\SecuritytxtBundle\BitExpertSuluSecuritytxtBundle::class => ['all' => true],
```

    prefix:   /admin/api

## Usage

Once installed, this bundle adds a tab called "Security.txt" to the webspaces configuration which allows you to create

Since 0.5.0: Only users with the Securitytxt permissions can view, add, edit or delete the security.txt entries.
